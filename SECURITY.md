## 🔒 Security Best Practices for Investigators

As this is a forensic tool, please adhere to the following security guidelines:

- **Environment Isolation**: Always run the suite in a controlled, isolated forensic environment (e.g., a dedicated VM) 💻.
- **Credential Management**: Ensure your `.env.local` file is **never** committed to version control. Use strong passwords for the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` 🔑.
- **Database Security**: Regularly audit your Supabase **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies to ensure only authorized investigators can access sensitive case data 🗄️.
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep your Node.js and Python dependencies updated to the latest stable versions to mitigate upstream vulnerabilities 🔄.
